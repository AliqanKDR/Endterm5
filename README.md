In this project, I developed a program for posting posts.
___

The project consists of classes: User, Role, Post, Category.
___

This program allows the admin to create posts, delete them, create users, give them roles, and delete them.
Users can display all the posts, save it to their profile and delete them.To create posts, we need to give a name, a description, select a category from the suggested ones, and the creation date will be indicated by the current date automatically.
